If you add an item in trigger:
Update the game file default file aswell

TODO's
Add cooldownperiod
Add loads of sounds
Add rotation of target object maybe


work out probably from first digit of soundset number:
PlaySound on person
PlaySound at location
PlaySound at Target

suggest looking at string for:
Soundset_9xx   look for 9 for play on person
Soundset_8xx   look for 8 for play at target
everyother num is play at trigger point
